**Theory of probability**</br>
Probability is numerical measure which indicates the chance of occurrence.

**Empirical Approach**</br>
 The empirical probability, relative frequency, or experimental probability of an event 
is the ratio of the number of outcomes in which a specified event occurs to the total number of trials,</br>
p = P(A) =  Number of times Event occured/total number of trails = m/n

**Continuous Probability Distributions**</br>
Continuous Probability Distribution: We can describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable using a probability density function.. A probability density function f(x) is a function that you can use to find the probabilities of a continuous variable across a range of values. It tells us what the shape of the probability distribution

**Normal Distribution**</br>
It is one of the most famous statistical distributions in use .The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution Several phenomenon are modelled with the normal distribution.

**F Distribution**</br>
The F-Distribution (the initial F is in honor of statistician Ronald Fisher) is a ratio of distributions that compares the variances of two populations.
